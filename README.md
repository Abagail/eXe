Gamer_Z eXtreme Party 24/7 - in short: eXe24

This DeathMatch mode began early development in june 2014.
Things started to go pretty serious in october 2014, so this has been noted as the development start date.

I decided to be the only* active server on SA-MP that open-sources its' GameMode.

The GameMode is mainly written in C++. Some libraries and parts of the code are in C.

Requirements for compilation:

- [Visual Studio 2013 or newer](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx)
- [msysgit](https://msysgit.github.io/)
- [2,0 GB of free hard drive space](http://www.bax-shop.nl/usb-stick/kingston-datatraveler-special-edition-9-usb-stick-8-gb)

------------------------------------

 \* - I could not find any other active servers that run custom open-source modes.

 \*\* - this requires editing the gamemode and including the relevant ODB library headers and source files (and any other needed stuff).
